#### README

    A friend asked me to fix a tool to sort scene releases from incoming     
    sections into archive dirs wich is sorted with _productname, the paths   
    in preview video is not REAL it's just empty folders for preview         
    how the tool works, don't blame me ;) 

    ./wuseman-activater.sh in the gif preview is exactly the same command as 
    ./start-resorting fyi to avoid questions about it. I did just rename the 
     file since because i created the preview file before the tool was done 
     enough to add to github. 

 #### REQUIREMENTS

    A linux setup would be good ;)

#### HOWTO

    git clone https://github.com/wuseman/warchiver
    cd warchiver
    edit warchiver and set a correct path for archive dir
    chmod +x start-resorting
    ./start-resporting

    Enjoy the magic! ;)
